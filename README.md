The project focuses on mental well-being, privacy, and emotional support, all without requiring any login.

1. User enters a **nickname** to make the conversation personal  
2. User answers **8 mental health-related questions**  
3. The AI calculates a **wellness score** based on the responses  
4. Based on the score, the AI provides **personalized suggestions**  
5. User is given an option to either:
   - End the session and receive a **motivational temporary token**  
   - Or continue chatting with the **simple supportive chatbot**  
6. The chatbot offers basic emotional support using predefined responses  
7. After interaction, the token fades — symbolizing that **difficulties are temporary**

## why us?
