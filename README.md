## Healthcare AI Related To Mental Health
 AI-driven mental health assistant designed to help users reflect on their emotions through a short 8-question wellness check. It provides personalized suggestions, offers a Smart AI Chatbot for supportive conversation, and rewards users with a temporary motivational token. The project focuses on mental well-being, privacy, and emotional support, all without requiring any login.

## Description
Mental-Health-AI is an AI chatbot that helps users assess their mental well-being through interactive questions and provides personalized self-care recommendations. It also engages users in calming activities like music therapy and story telling to enhance mental relaxation.


## Tag-line
>"*A Friend That Listens, Suggests, and Cares — That's Mental-Health-AI.*"

## Features

- Anonymous Interaction (no login, just nickname)
- 8-question mental health assessment
- Personalized wellness suggestions
- Smart Supportive Chatbot (rule-based)
- **Relaxing music** for calming the user after assessment
- **Self-care activities**
   > Breathing
   > Meditation

## Workflow 

1. User enters a **nickname** to make the conversation personal
 
2. User answers **8 mental health-related questions**

3. The AI calculates a **wellness score** based on the responses
   
4. Based on the score, the AI provides **personalized suggestions** acording to respective mental health level(low, moderate, high)
 
5. User is given an option to either:
   - End the session and receive a **Motivational Temporary Token**  
   - Or continue chatting with the **Smart Supportive Chatbot**
     
6. The Chatbot offers emotional support using predefined responses  
7. After interaction, the token fades — symbolizing that **difficulties are temporary too**

## Why Us?
>"*Just like the token disappears, struggles too will fade. Our project focuses on reminding the user that everything is temporary — including their current emotional state.*"

It is simple, fast, and focused on making users feel better without worrying about accounts, data, and complexity.
